# frontend/react (Vite SPA), the single and split deploy modes, the react stacks, catalog v1.2.0

Status: active
Owner: Eitan
Last updated: 2026-10-24
Approval: Eitan, 2026-10-24 ("initiate the new plan"), with the Open Questions' recommendations;
ADR 0003 is approved separately at G1. Direction set in conversation on 2026-10-24:

- Milestone 5 follows ADR 0001 › Delivery order.
- A project with an SPA starts as one container and can move to another topology later, when
  scale or hosting calls for it.
- The SPA shape is defined once, for React now and for Vue and Angular later.

Branch: `feat/frontend-react` in both repositories, cut from `dev` after G0
Base: harness adebb89 (`main`), catalog 0b97243 (`main`). G0 fast-forwards `dev` to these.
Stages: harness and catalog only. No role agents run. The interactive session drives:

- a Sonnet implementer per task, with a Sonnet review per task;
- one Opus final review per repository.

It ends in one pull request per repository into `dev`.

## Goal

Milestone 5 adds the first single-page-app frontend and lets a project choose how it ships.
After it:

- **New stacks.**
  `bun tools/generate.ts --stack react-python-fastapi [--deploy single|split] [--capability database=postgres]`
  writes a project whose `frontend/` is React on Vite. Its typed client is generated from the
  server's `openapi.json`. The same works for `react-bun-express`.
- **`single`, the default for an SPA stack.** One image runs the API and serves the built SPA
  on one port. There is no CORS, no API URL in the bundle and no second container.
- **`split`.** The frontend gets its own small static-server image, which proxies `/api` to
  the server. Code is identical in both modes; only Dockerfiles and Compose differ. Next
  stacks are always `split`.
- **Both server templates** serve a built frontend when `STATIC_DIR` is set, under one tested
  behaviour table. Unset, they behave exactly as today.
- **The SPA contract is written once,** in `docs/conventions.md` and ADR 0003. Vue and Angular
  templates implement it later.
- **CI proves every mode.** It builds the images, smokes them, and runs the e2e suite with the
  axe scan against the running container.
- **The harness** asks for the deploy mode at the bootstrap and records it. A new `deployment`
  skill moves an existing project between `single`, `split` and a static host. Root files stop
  assuming a server-rendered frontend.

The catalog ships as `v1.2.0` and the harness lock follows it.

## Scope

**In, catalog side** (`fullstack-templates`):

- ADR 0003, `docs/adr/0003-spa-and-deploy-modes.md`, with decisions M5-1 to M5-10. Also:
  - `docs/conventions.md`: the SPA frontend contract and the deploy modes;
  - an ADR 0001 amendment for v1.2.0.
- Machinery:
  - the `static` manifest field;
  - the `--deploy` option and its answers and provenance fields;
  - the reserved `single` marker selection;
  - the `__FRONTEND_DIR__` placeholder;
  - per-mode Compose assembly;
  - the headings check extended to frontend templates and to `Deployment`;
  - per-mode `test-generated --with-app` with e2e against the container;
  - a `deploy` field on cases.
- `frontend/react` 1.0.0: `base/`, the Dockerfile with `dist` and `serve` targets, the static
  server config, the Compose fragment, the cases, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `server/bun-express` 2.3.0 and `server/python-fastapi` 1.1.0:
  - static serving behind `STATIC_DIR`, with its tests;
  - `@single` lines in the Dockerfile and the Compose fragment;
  - `AGENTS.md › Deployment`.
- `frontend/next` 1.1.1: `AGENTS.md › Deployment` only.
- `stacks/react-python-fastapi/` and `stacks/react-bun-express/`, plus their `index.yaml`
  entries.
- Docs: `README.md` (generated matrix), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (adding an SPA template, refreshing
  the React base), the catalog's `CLAUDE.md` (the frontend shape and the deploy modes).

**In, harness side** (this repository):

- `scripts/bootstrap.mjs`: pass `--deploy` through and print next steps per mode.
- `bootstrap-project` skill: ask the deploy mode when the stack's frontend declares `static`,
  write the client model per frontend kind, and fill the Deployment line.
- The new `.claude/skills/deployment/SKILL.md` and its row in `AGENTS.md › Skills`.
- Neutral text for an SSR or SPA frontend in:
  - `AGENTS.md` (Stack, Architecture);
  - `.doc/architecture.md` (Primary Components, Data Flow, Auth client model, Deployment);
  - the `error-handling` and `writing-tests` skills;
  - `README.md`.
- This plan.
- After the tag: the `catalog.lock` bump to `v1.2.0`.

**Out:**

- `frontend/vue` and `frontend/angular`. This milestone only writes the contract they follow.
- A generated static-host (CDN) mode. The `deployment` skill documents it, because it changes
  the CORS and cookie security model per product (OQ10).
- Host-specific deploy files (Fly, Render, Railway, Cloud Run, Kubernetes manifests).
- An auth UI in the template. Like `next`, it ships only the `health` feature.
- Server-side rendering for React, and React Router framework mode.
- MongoDB, Redis, workers, messaging (milestones 6 to 8).
- Updating existing projects to newer templates (ADR 0001 non-goal). The deploy switch is a
  planned project change through the skill, not a regeneration.
- An unattended eval. Plan 009's V40 stays the open eval follow-up.
- The `migrate` env-reader follow-up from ADR 0002. It stays in the catalog backlog.

## Assumptions

- **G0 has not run.** In both repositories `dev` is behind `main`:
  - catalog `origin/dev` 7950ddf against `main` 0b97243;
  - harness `origin/dev` 884968e against `main` adebb89.

  `main` contains `dev` in both, so G0 is a fast-forward, not a rewrite.
- ADR 0001, ADR 0002, their amendments and the rulings of plans 008 and 009 stand. This plan
  reopens none of them.
- The ADR 0001 frontend contract (D4) already allows the SPA shape: "the data access
  (`server/` for a server-rendered framework, `api/` otherwise)".
- **Generator facts this plan builds on** (catalog `tools/lib/`):
  - markers already take a reserved `server` selection (`plan.ts` `SERVER_SELECTION`), applied
    to package files and Compose fragments alike;
  - cases already carry `withApp`;
  - the fixture catalog has `frontend/mini-ui`;
  - `dry-run.ts` varies `server` like a flag, then removes it and passes it as `hasServer`.
    `single` needs the same handling, restricted to combinations where `server` is true.
- **Overlay facts** (checked 2026-10-24). Neither Postgres overlay shadows a `Dockerfile`, a
  `compose.yaml`, the server's assembly file or its env module. So the `@single` lines and the
  static mount live in `base/` only, and S2 is expected to move no pin.
- **CSP facts.** python-fastapi's `middleware/security_headers.py` already sends helmet's
  default CSP string, so both servers send the same CSP on static responses.
- **Next headings.** `frontend/next/base/AGENTS.md` already has Adding a feature, Styling,
  Errors and Tests. Next 1.1.1 adds only Deployment.
- The auth model in `.doc/architecture.md` is unchanged. The server's cookies are already
  httpOnly, `SameSite=Lax` and `Secure` outside development (`services/security/cookies.ts`).
  In `single` and `split` the browser and the API share one origin, so CORS stays off.
- Local machine as recorded in plan 009: Bun 1.4.0, Node 24.15, uv 0.12.23, Docker 29.7.
  Compose `additional_contexts` needs Compose 2.17 or later.
- **Work in another repository.** Work in `C:\Dev\Playground\AI\fullstack-templates` starts
  only after Eitan approves this plan, which names that path.
- **The user's rules hold:**
  - Sonnet for implementers and task reviewers, Opus for final reviews;
  - Conventional Commits;
  - no commit, push, PR, merge or tag without Eitan's explicit yes at execution time;
  - agents never rewrite history;
  - hook changes, if any turn out to be needed, are made in a worktree only.

## Open Questions

1. **Which router and data library does the React template use?** React Router 7 in data mode
   gives per-route `loader`, `action`, `ErrorBoundary` and `HydrateFallback`. Those mirror
   Next's loaders, server actions, `error.tsx` and `loading.tsx`, so an agent finds the same
   shape in both frontends, and only one library is added. TanStack Query adds a cache the
   template does not need. Recommended: React Router 7 data mode, no TanStack Query; a product
   adds a cache library by plan.
2. **What is the option called, and what is its default?** Recommended: `--deploy single|split`.
   The default is `single` when the stack has a server and its frontend declares `static`, and
   `split` otherwise. `single` is refused for Next and for a lone frontend.
3. **Is the server's static serving gated at generation or at runtime?** Recommended: always
   shipped in both server templates and inert unless `STATIC_DIR` is set. Only Dockerfile and
   Compose lines carry `@single` markers. Moving between modes is then configuration, and no
   case multiplies.
4. **How does the single image get the SPA's build?** The preferred shape keeps the build in
   the frontend's Dockerfile (its `dist` target), and the server build reads it through a
   Compose additional context (`service:` reference). The fallback is a shared `@single` build
   stage reading the frontend directory as a local named context. S1 decides, and ADR 0003
   records the choice.
   - `service:` is chosen only if S1 proves it on both Windows and Linux. Windows is a
     first-class host (ADR 0001 › Constraints), so a Windows failure picks the fallback; it
     does not make `single` Linux-only. An inconclusive S1 also picks the fallback.
   - With the fallback, the frontend's Compose fragment is not assembled in `single`.
   - With `service:`, it is assembled as a build-only service (`build.target: dist`, no
     ports, never started by `--profile app up`). M5-4, V04 and the `deployment` skill's
     steps then follow that shape.

   Recommended: the `service:` reference if S1 proves it on both hosts, otherwise the
   local-context fallback.
5. **Which static server runs in the split frontend image?** Recommended:
   `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged`. It is the industry default, non-root out of the box, and
   templates its port from the environment. Caddy is the alternative if S1 finds the SPA
   fallback and proxy config simpler there.
6. **Is `react-bun-express` added as well as `react-python-fastapi`?** Recommended: yes. It is
   one `stack.yaml`, and without it bun-express's static serving has no end-to-end or image
   proof.
7. **Where does the move between topologies live?** Recommended: a harness `deployment` skill
   for the stack-neutral procedure. Each template's `AGENTS.md › Deployment` holds its own
   files and lines, and the headings check enforces it.
8. **What is `TRUST_PROXY`'s default in `single`?** Recommended: `false` in the `single` Compose
   fragment, because the container is the edge locally and a default of 1 lets any caller pick
   its rate-limit key. The deployment skill and the Deployment line require the production
   hop count, which is 1 behind a PaaS edge. `split` keeps 1, because nginx counts.
9. **Which dev port does the React template use?** Recommended: 5173, Vite's convention. A
   port other than 3000 also proves the frontend port flows through the generator.
10. **Is a static-host (CDN) mode generated?** Recommended: no. A frontend on another origin
    needs `CORS_ORIGINS`, cross-site cookies (`SameSite=None`, a cookie domain) and a CSRF
    stance. That is a product security decision, so the `deployment` skill documents it as a
    planned change.

## Steps

No product API changes. The OpenAPI document is unchanged: static responses sit outside
`/api` and outside the contract. There is no Contract subsection.

### Gates

- **G0 (Eitan, or the session on his yes):** fast-forward `dev` to `main` in both
  repositories, then cut `feat/frontend-react` in both.
- **G1 (Eitan):** approve ADR 0003 before T1 and every later catalog task. H1 does not depend
  on the ADR and may start with A0.
- **S1 spike** (time-boxed to half a day, alongside the ADR draft). Scratch work only; findings
  go into ADR 0003. On Windows (Docker Desktop) and Linux, it proves:
  - **image assembly.** OQ4: a Compose `service:` additional context to a build-only service
    at a `dist` target, with that service never started by `--profile app up`. It also covers
    the fallback, a local-path named context. Record whether `.dockerignore` applies to a named
    context;
  - **static serving.** Express 5 static files and fallback, and the Starlette equivalent, with
    HEAD, traversal and dotfiles, against the rows in M5-5;
  - **CSP in the browser.** Helmet's default CSP, including `upgrade-insecure-requests`, lets
    the Vite production build load in Chromium over `http://localhost` from the container;
  - **the client in tests.** `openapi-fetch` with `baseUrl: window.location.origin` works
    under Vitest jsdom with a stubbed `fetch`;
  - **versions.** The React set resolves and locks under Bun 1.4: React 19, React Router 7,
    Vite, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, Vitest 5, Playwright;
  - **the split image.** nginx-unprivileged with a templated port, the SPA fallback, the `/api`
    proxy and the security headers, running non-root.

### Decisions (ADR 0003 records these; implementers do not reopen them)

- **M5-1 The SPA frontend contract** (conventions.md › Frontend, single-page app).
  - **`src/app/` is routing only.**
    - `routes.tsx` is the route table.
    - The root has `layout.tsx` and `not-found.tsx`.
    - Each route segment has `page.tsx`, `loading.tsx` (the hydrate and pending fallback) and
      `error.tsx` (the route's error boundary).
    - `src/main.tsx` mounts the router and the toaster and nothing else.
  - **`feature/<name>/` holds `ui/`, `api/` and `model.ts`.**
    - `api/` holds the route loaders and actions.
    - Only `feature/*/api/` imports `lib/api/client` (lint).
    - Import direction is `app → feature → shared, lib`.
  - **The API is always reached at relative `/api/*`** on the page's own origin, in every deploy
    mode. In development, the dev server proxies `/api` to the server's port. No API URL is
    compiled into the bundle, and there is no CORS.
  - **`build` writes `dist/`,** with `index.html` at its root and hashed files under
    `dist/assets/`. The manifest declares `static: { out: dist }`.
  - **`src/env.ts` is the only reader of `import.meta.env`** (lint). It holds browser-visible
    values only and never a secret.
  - **E2E.** When `E2E_BASE_URL` is set, Playwright tests that URL and starts no web server;
    otherwise it starts the server's dev command and the dev server.
  - **The Dockerfile has two targets:** `dist` (the built files only, at `/dist`) and the
    default `serve` (the split-mode static server).
  - **The agents file has these headings:** layer map, Adding a feature, Styling, Errors,
    Tests, Deployment.
- **M5-2 The React template.**
  - **Libraries:** React 19 (the version `next` pins), React Router 7 data mode (OQ1), Vite with
    `@vitejs/plugin-react`, Tailwind 4 through `@tailwindcss/vite`, sonner, lucide-react,
    openapi-fetch with openapi-typescript, zod, Vitest with Testing Library and jsdom,
    Playwright with `@axe-core/playwright`, Prettier.
  - **Lint:** ESLint with typescript-eslint `strictTypeChecked`, react-hooks and jsx-a11y.
  - **Versions** are current stable at R1, verified against the registry, locked in `bun.lock`
    and listed in ADR 0003. They are never written from memory.
  - **Manifest:**
    - `http: { port: 5173, health: / }`;
    - `defaultStack: react-python-fastapi`;
    - the same command vocabulary as `next`, with `contract` running `bun run api:types`.
  - **Styling:** tokens are CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`, exposed with `@theme
    inline`, as in `next`.
- **M5-3 The client.** `lib/api/client.ts` builds
  `createClient<paths>({ baseUrl: window.location.origin, fetch: (r) => globalThis.fetch(r) })`.
  - The origin is resolved explicitly, because undici's `Request` refuses a bare path.
  - Requests carry the session cookies by fetch's same-origin default.
  - The CSRF stance is recorded in ADR 0003: same origin, `SameSite=Lax` cookies, JSON-only
    bodies and CORS off mean a cross-site page cannot send an authenticated mutation.
- **M5-4 Deploy modes.**
  - **Inputs.** `--deploy single|split` on the CLI, `deploy` in the answers JSON, and `deploy` in
    `.fullstack/catalog.yaml` (an optional provenance field; `schemaVersion` stays 1).
  - **`single`** (OQ2 default):
    - the server's image holds the API and the SPA's `dist/`, and serves both on the server's
      port;
    - the frontend gets no runtime Compose service; whether its fragment exists as a
      build-only service follows OQ4;
    - every package's markers see the reserved selection `single` as true. It is never true
      in a plan without a server.
  - **`split`:** each package has its own image, as today.
  - **Refusals.** `--deploy single` with a frontend that lacks `static`, or with no server in
    the plan, fails and names the reason. An unknown value fails.
  - **`__FRONTEND_DIR__`** resolves to the frontend's directory, for the server's fragment.
  - **The mode is fixed at generation.** Changing it later is a project change through the
    `deployment` skill. Provenance stays the generation record and is not edited.
    - `.doc/architecture.md › Deployment` holds the current mode, and wins when it differs
      from provenance. Provenance says what was generated; the doc says what runs now.
  - **Ports.** The frontend's `http.port` is always its dev-server port, and in `split` also
    its container's port. In `single`, the deployed app and the app smoke use the server's
    port. `printNextSteps` names the frontend's dev URL in both modes.
  - **`static.out`.** The loader checks only that it is present. The app smoke proves that the
    `dist` target holds an `index.html` (M5-8).
- **M5-5 Static serving in both servers** (OQ3).
  - **Configuration.** The env module reads `STATIC_DIR` once. Unset, nothing is mounted. Set in
    production without an `index.html`, boot fails fast.
  - **Order.** It is mounted after the API routes and `/openapi.json` and before not-found, and
    never under `/api`.
  - **Behaviour table** (identical in both templates, each row tested in both):

    | Request | Response |
    | --- | --- |
    | GET or HEAD of an existing file | The file. `assets/*` gets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; `index.html` gets `no-cache`. |
    | GET or HEAD of an extension-less path outside `/api` | `index.html`, `no-cache`. The SPA's router renders it, its own not-found included. |
    | A path with an extension and no file | The 404 envelope. |
    | `/api/*` with no route | The 404 envelope, unchanged. |
    | Another method on a non-API path | The 404 envelope, unchanged. |
    | A dotfile, an encoded traversal or a directory | The 404 envelope. Never a listing. |

    Every static response carries the security headers, CSP included.
  - **Files.**
    - bun-express: `src/middleware/static.ts`, the mount in `src/server.ts`, the `STATIC_DIR`
      parse in `src/config/env.ts` and `.env.example`, and the ESLint zone.
    - python-fastapi: `src/app/middleware/static_files.py`, the mount in `src/app/server.py`,
      `config/env.py`, `.env.example` and the import-linter contracts.
  - **No compression** in the server; the host's edge compresses. ADR 0003 lists it under "left
    to the deployment".
- **M5-6 The single image and its Compose service.**
  - **The SPA build stays in the frontend's Dockerfile** (`dist` target).
  - **The server's Dockerfile** gains `@single` lines that copy `/dist` from the `spa` context
    to `public/` beside the app and set `STATIC_DIR` to that path. The mechanism follows OQ4
    and S1.
  - **The server's Compose fragment** gains `@single` and `@nosingle` lines:
    - `build.additional_contexts.spa`;
    - `TRUST_PROXY: ${TRUST_PROXY:-false}` in `single`, where `split` keeps
      `${TRUST_PROXY:-1}` (OQ8);
    - **Ports.**
      - In `single`, `ports: ["__PORT__:__PORT__"]`. The server is now the public edge, as the
        frontend container is today, and with `TRUST_PROXY` false no caller can choose its own
        client IP.
      - In `split`, the loopback-only `127.0.0.1` publishing stays.
    - **Comments.** Each mode gets its own comments in place of the ones that say "the Next.js
      server counts" and that justify loopback by `TRUST_PROXY=1`.
  - **Unchanged:** the derived `<dir>-migrate` service, which shares the image name and keeps
    working.
- **M5-7 The split frontend image** (OQ5).
  - nginx-unprivileged, non-root, listening on `__PORT__`.
  - Hashed assets are immutable and `index.html` is `no-cache`. An extension-less path falls
    back to `index.html`.
  - `/api/` is proxied to `__SERVER_DIR__:__SERVER_PORT__` with `X-Forwarded-For`. The proxy
    lines carry `@server`, so a lone frontend has none.
  - Static responses carry the same security headers as the server's.
  - The backend keeps `TRUST_PROXY` 1 here, because nginx counts as the hop.
- **M5-8 Proof per mode** (`test-generated --with-app`).
  - **`single`:**
    - health and ready on the server's port;
    - `/` and a deep link return `index.html`;
    - `/api/nope` returns the JSON 404;
    - the image's `public/` holds only built files (no `src/`, `.env*` or `*.map`);
    - then the frontend's `testE2e` with `E2E_BASE_URL` pointed at the container.
  - **`split`:** the same through the frontend's port, plus `/api/health` through the proxy, and
    the frontend container running as a non-root user.
- **M5-9 The `deployment` skill and `AGENTS.md › Deployment`** (OQ7).
  - **Headings check.** The catalog's check extends to frontend templates (Adding a feature,
    Styling, Errors, Tests, Deployment) and adds Deployment to servers.
  - **The harness skill covers:**
    - choosing a mode;
    - single → split and split → single, as file-level steps that cite each package's
      `AGENTS.md › Deployment`, the root `docker-compose.yml` and `TRUST_PROXY`;
    - a static host (CDN) as a documented security change (OQ10);
    - what scaling actually needs: state out of process (the database, the cache task) and jobs
      on exactly one replica.
  - **Where the mode lives.** The current mode is recorded in `.doc/architecture.md ›
    Operational Concerns › Deployment`, with a change-log line when it moves.
- **M5-10 Versions.**
  - catalog `v1.2.0`: additive, so `schemaVersion` stays 1 and the harness's
    `SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1` holds;
  - frontend/react 1.0.0;
  - bun-express 2.3.0;
  - python-fastapi 1.1.0;
  - next 1.1.1.

### Execution protocol

As in plan 009 › Execution protocol: a self-contained brief per dispatch (goal, read first,
binding M5 numbers, paths, done-when commands, report). The standing rules hold:

- verify every third-party API against the installed package or its current docs;
- tests first;
- no skip or focus;
- no edits outside the listed paths;
- stop and report when a decision cannot be met.

**Behaviour ledger.** Each M5-5 row maps to one test name per server, and V06 audits it. It
lives in `.superpowers/sdd/010-2026-10-24-frontend-react/progress.md` (git-ignored).

Template gates run in a generated case with `--keep`, never inside a raw `base/` (catalog
`CLAUDE.md`). Python tasks also run their gates on Linux, as the plan 009 As built requires.

### Catalog tasks (paths relative to `fullstack-templates/`)

1. **A0, ADR 0003** (with S1).
   - `docs/adr/0003-spa-and-deploy-modes.md`: M5-1 to M5-10, the static behaviour table, the S1
     findings and the versions.
   - `docs/conventions.md`: the SPA contract and the deploy modes.
   - `docs/adr/0001-catalog-architecture.md`: the v1.2.0 amendment.
   - Gate G1 follows.
2. **T1, machinery** (~800 LOC: the dry-run's reserved-selection handling is generalised from
   `server` to `server` and `single`).
   - Schemas:
     - `schemas/template.schema.json` gains `static` (frontend only);
     - `schemas/cases.schema.json` gains `deploy`;
     - `schemas/provenance.schema.json` gains an optional `deploy`.
   - `tools/lib/cli.ts` and `plan.ts`: `--deploy`, answers, the default and the refusals, and
     the reserved `single` selection in `selectionsFor`.
   - `tools/lib/generate.ts`: `FRONTEND_DIR` in `packagePlaceholders`, and skipping the
     frontend's fragment in `single`.
   - `tools/lib/dry-run.ts`: `single` varied like `server`, and skipped when `server` is false.
   - `tools/lib/provenance.ts`.
   - The headings check (M5-9) in `tools/lib/catalog.ts`.
   - Fixture: `tools/tests/fixtures/catalog/frontend/mini-spa/` (declares `static`), plus a
     stack using it.
   - Tests in `tools/tests/{plan,generate,compose,dry-run,catalog,provenance,generate-cli}.test.ts`.
3. **T2, the per-mode app smoke** (~300 LOC, parallel with S2).
   - `tools/lib/run-case.ts` and `tools/test-generated.ts`: the M5-8 checks and e2e against the
     container.
   - `tools/tests/run-case.test.ts`.
4. **S2, static serving in both servers** (~500 LOC with tests).
   - The M5-5 files in `server/bun-express/base/` and `server/python-fastapi/base/`.
   - Tests:
     - bun-express: `tests/middleware/static.test.ts`;
     - python-fastapi: `tests/middleware/test_static_files.py`.
   - The `@single` lines in both `Dockerfile`s and `compose.yaml`s (M5-6).
   - Pins: none expected (see Assumptions, overlay facts). If `validate` reports a moved pin,
     reconcile the overlay copy and re-pin with `validate --pin`, reading the diff.
   - `AGENTS.md › Deployment` in both.
   - Versions, CHANGELOGs and `index.yaml`.
5. **R1, the React base** (~1.2k LOC without the lockfile).
   - `frontend/react/template.yaml` and `tests/cases.yaml`.
   - `base/`:
     - `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `vite.config.ts` (the dev proxy from `__SERVER_PORT__`),
       `tsconfig*.json`, `eslint.config.mjs` (M5-1 zones, the `import.meta.env` rule),
       `.prettierrc`, `vitest.config.mts`, `playwright.config.ts` (the M5-1 E2E rule,
       `__SERVER_DEV_COMMAND__`), `index.html`, `.env.example`;
     - `src/main.tsx`, `src/env.ts`;
     - `src/app/{routes,layout,not-found}.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`, and
       `src/app/home/{page,loading,error}.tsx`;
     - `src/feature/health/{model.ts,api/health.ts,ui/health-status.tsx,ui/refresh-button.tsx}`;
     - `src/lib/api/{client.ts,schema.d.ts}` (generated from python-fastapi, per D2's
       lone-frontend rule);
     - `src/shared/{lib,ui}/`;
     - `tests/unit/*`, `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`.
6. **R2, packaging and stacks** (~300 LOC).
   - `frontend/react/base/Dockerfile` (`dist` and `serve` targets), `.dockerignore`, the nginx
     config, and `frontend/react/compose.yaml`.
   - `stacks/react-python-fastapi/stack.yaml`, `stacks/react-bun-express/stack.yaml`, and the
     `index.yaml` entries.
   - **Cases:**

     | Case | Stack | Deploy | Extras |
     | --- | --- | --- | --- |
     | `default` | react-python-fastapi | `single` | `withApp` |
     | `split` | react-python-fastapi | `split` | `withApp` |
     | `bun` | react-bun-express | `single` | `withApp` |
     | `postgres` | react-python-fastapi | `single` | Postgres, `withApp` |
     | `alone` | none | none | |

     There is no react `auth-off` case. The React template has no flags, and the server's
     `auth=false` cases already cover the server. Static serving touches no auth code, and the
     dry-run covers every `single` × `auth` marker combination.

   - `frontend/react/{AGENTS.md,README.md,CHANGELOG.md}`. `base/AGENTS.md` uses the M5-1
     headings.
7. **T3, release docs.**
   - `README.md` (`bun tools/validate.ts --readme`), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the catalog `CLAUDE.md`.
   - `frontend/next` 1.1.1: `AGENTS.md › Deployment`, CHANGELOG.
   - ADR 0003 As built.
   - v1.2.0 notes, drafted for the annotated tag.

### Harness tasks (paths relative to this repository)

8. **H1, bootstrap passthrough** (alongside A0).
   - `scripts/bootstrap.mjs`: `--deploy` in the usage text, `parseArgs` and the generator
     argv.
   - `printNextSteps`:
     - in `single`, one app service and the frontend's dev URL;
     - in `split`, today's text.
9. **H2, text and skills** (after T1 fixes the option and R2 fixes the headings).
   - **`bootstrap-project` skill:**
     - in section 2, ask the deploy mode when the chosen frontend's `template.yaml` has
       `static`, with a two-line tradeoff, and map the answer to `--deploy`;
     - in section 1, the Auth none client model per frontend kind;
     - in section 4, the dev-server check wording;
     - in section 5, fill `Deployment` and the Stack row.
   - **`.claude/skills/deployment/SKILL.md`** (M5-9), plus its row in `AGENTS.md › Skills`.
   - **`AGENTS.md`:**
     - Stack: Docker Compose runs one image per deployable, per the deploy mode;
     - Architecture: two packages and one contract, where the deploy mode decides one image or
       two.
   - **`.doc/architecture.md`:**
     - Primary Components without SSR or port assumptions;
     - Data Flow steps 1 to 4 phrased through the feature's data layer;
     - the Auth client model as a FILL the bootstrap writes per frontend kind;
     - Deployment gains `Deploy mode: <!-- FILL -->` and the `TRUST_PROXY` hop count.
   - **`error-handling` and `writing-tests` skills:** "server action" becomes the package's
     action.
   - **`README.md`:** the stacks and modes.
10. **H3, proofs** (after R2). Scratch roots under `.superpowers/s010/`, bootstrapped with
    `--templates` from the catalog branch: V30 to V36.
11. **H4, lock bump** (after Eitan tags `v1.2.0`). `catalog.lock`, with a fresh-cache bootstrap
    (V37). A separate one-line PR.

## Validation

**Catalog**

- V01 — The tools pass their own gates — proof: `cd tools && bun run check`.
- V02 — The catalog validates: the README matrix is current, the lockfiles are frozen, and
  every marker combination, including `single` on and off, dry-runs — proof:
  `bun tools/validate.ts`; `bun tools/validate.ts --lockfiles`.
- V03 — `--deploy` behaves as M5-4: an SPA stack defaults to `single` and a Next stack to
  `split`; `single` is refused, with the reason, for Next and for a lone frontend; an unknown
  value is refused; answers and provenance carry the mode — proof: `tools/tests/plan.test.ts`,
  `generate-cli.test.ts`, `provenance.test.ts`.
- V04 — In `single`, the frontend has no runtime Compose service (and a build-only one only
  under OQ4's `service:` choice). The server's service has `spa`, `STATIC_DIR`, `TRUST_PROXY`
  false and the all-interface port. `__FRONTEND_DIR__` resolves. A Next stack's output
  differs from v1.1.0 only by the inert static-serving files and the Deployment sections — proof:
  `tools/tests/compose.test.ts`, `generate.test.ts`, `real-catalog.test.ts`, and a recursive
  diff of `next-python-fastapi` generated from `v1.1.0` and from the branch.
- V05 — A frontend agents file missing Adding a feature, Styling, Errors, Tests or Deployment
  fails `validate`, and so does a server agents file missing Deployment — proof:
  `tools/tests/catalog.test.ts`.
- V06 — Every M5-5 row is asserted in both servers, and every pre-existing server test passes
  with `STATIC_DIR` unset — proof: `tests/middleware/static.test.ts`,
  `tests/middleware/test_static_files.py`, and the behaviour ledger audit.
- V07 — With `STATIC_DIR` set in production and no `index.html`, both servers refuse to boot
  with a clear message — proof: the env tests in both templates.
- V08 — Lint fails on a seeded import of `lib/api/client` from `ui/`, on a cross-feature `ui/`
  import, and on `import.meta.env` outside `src/env.ts`, each with its message — proof: probes
  recorded in the ledger, and a green `lint` in every react case.
- V09 — Every react case passes `check` and `testE2e` with the axe scan, with services where
  the case has them: `default`, `split`, `bun`, `postgres`, `alone` — proof:
  `bun tools/test-generated.ts --case frontend/react/<each> --e2e --with-services`.
- V10 — In `single`, one container serves `/`, a deep link, `/api/health` and
  `/api/health/ready`, and `/api/nope` is the JSON 404. Its `public/` holds no `src/`, `.env*`
  or `*.map`. The e2e suite passes against it through `E2E_BASE_URL`. In `postgres`, the
  migrate one-shot exits 0 first — proof:
  `bun tools/test-generated.ts --case frontend/react/<default|bun|postgres> --e2e --with-services --with-app`.
- V11 — In `split`, the frontend container runs as a non-root user, serves the SPA with the
  security headers on `index.html`, and proxies `/api/health`; the e2e suite passes against it
  — proof: `bun tools/test-generated.ts --case frontend/react/split --e2e --with-app`.
- V12 — Every existing case still passes (regression) — proof:
  `bun tools/test-generated.ts --case server/<each>/<each> --case frontend/next/<each> --e2e --with-services --with-app`.
- V13 — On Windows (Docker Desktop), `single` builds and passes the app smoke. This blocks the
  release, because Windows is a first-class host — proof:
  `bun tools/test-generated.ts --case frontend/react/default --with-app` on Eitan's machine.
- V14 — The catalog PR is green: `validate` and every case job, with the smoke steps — proof:
  the PR's checks.
- V15 — The React template has no `.skip`, `.only`, `test.fixme` or `describe.skip` — proof:
  grep `frontend/react` for those forms.

**Harness**

- V30 — Bootstrapping `react-python-fastapi` with the default (`single`) passes every gate
  (`check` in both packages, `testE2e`). Then `docker compose --profile app up --build --wait`
  runs one app container that answers `/` and `/api/health` on one port — proof: the commands
  in `.superpowers/s010/py-single`.
- V31 — Bootstrapping `react-python-fastapi` with `--deploy split` passes every gate, and the
  app profile runs two containers — proof: `.superpowers/s010/py-split`.
- V32 — `react-python-fastapi`, `single`, with Postgres: `migrate`, `testDb` (none skipped),
  then the app profile with the migrate one-shot — proof: `.superpowers/s010/py-pg`.
- V33 — `react-bun-express` in `single` passes every gate and the app smoke — proof:
  `.superpowers/s010/bun-single`.
- V34 — `next-python-fastapi` still bootstraps green (regression), and `--deploy single` on it
  stops with the generator's reason — proof: `.superpowers/s010/next-py`.
- V35 — The migration drill: following the `deployment` skill alone, a Sonnet agent moves
  V30's project from `single` to `split`. Every gate, the app smoke and e2e against the
  frontend container are green, and `.doc/architecture.md` records the move — proof: the
  drill's transcript and commands in `.superpowers/s010/py-single`.
- V36 — No root file assumes a server-rendered frontend or one image per package without
  justification — proof: grep `AGENTS.md .doc .claude/rules .claude/agents .claude/skills` for
  `server action|server component|one image per package|NEXT_PUBLIC|port 3000|port 4000`, with
  every hit justified.
- V37 — A fresh-cache bootstrap from `v1.2.0` works after the lock bump — proof: H4's proof
  run.
- V38 — The hook suite is unchanged and green — proof:
  `node --test ".claude/hooks/test/*.test.mjs"`.

## Risks

- **Compose `service:` contexts may not build a service that is never started, or may behave
  differently on Windows.** Mitigation: S1 on both hosts, the local-path fallback (OQ4), and
  V13 on Windows, because CI is Linux.
- **The SPA fallback could swallow API 404s or answer a missing asset with HTML.** Mitigation:
  the M5-5 table, tested row by row in both servers (V06), plus the smoke checks (V10).
- **Helmet's CSP (`upgrade-insecure-requests`, `script-src 'self'`) could break the built SPA
  over plain HTTP.** Mitigation: S1 in Chromium, and e2e against the running container (V10,
  V11).
- **A secret could reach the browser bundle** through a `VITE_*` value or a `.env` file copied
  into the image. Mitigation: `env.ts` is the only reader (lint), `.dockerignore` excludes
  `.env*`, and V10 checks the image contents.
- **A spoofed client IP in `single`** (`TRUST_PROXY` 1 with no proxy in front). Mitigation: the
  default is `false` (OQ8), and the skill and the Deployment line require the production hop
  count.
- **Cookie and CSRF regressions when a product moves the frontend to another origin.**
  Mitigation: the move is not generated (OQ10); the skill lists the CORS, cookie and CSRF
  changes as a planned security change.
- **The two servers' static behaviour could drift.** Mitigation: one table, the ledger, and V06.
- **React Router, Vite or Tailwind majors churn.** Mitigation: versions locked in `bun.lock` and
  recorded in ADR 0003, and a refresh procedure in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Scope creep into host-specific deploy files.** Mitigation: Out of scope. The skill stays
  topology-level.

## Rollout Order

1. G0. Then cut `feat/frontend-react` in both repositories.
2. A0 alongside S1 and H1. Then G1.
3. T1.
4. T2 alongside S2.
5. R1, then R2.
6. T3.

Each task gets a Sonnet review against ADR 0003 and the ledger.

- **Catalog:** one Opus final review and a fix wave; V12 and V13 locally; V14 after the push.
- **Harness:** H2 after R2, H3 after H2, then one Opus final review and a fix wave.
- **Release:** the two PRs into `dev`, with Eitan's yes. Eitan merges, merges `dev` → `main` and
  tags `v1.2.0`. Then H4.

## Rollback

- Each repository's change is one branch merged into `dev`. Revert the merge commit there.
- Until H4, the harness lock still pins `v1.1.0`, so every bootstrap is untouched.
- After the tag, revert H4's one-line lock change. A bad catalog tag is superseded by a patch
  tag, never moved.
- The Next stacks' generated output changes only by the inert static code and the Deployment
  sections (V04). A
  generated project is standalone: switching its deploy mode back is the `deployment` skill
  run in reverse, and no data changes.

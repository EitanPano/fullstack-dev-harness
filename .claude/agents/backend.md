# Backend engineer

You implement exactly the Contract of an approved plan in `backend/`, test-first, and
prove it with the gates. `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/rules/` and `backend/AGENTS.md` are the
standard; do not restate them.

The boundary hook refuses any write outside `backend/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `db/` and
`.orchestrate/*/backend.md` (`*` is the task slug), and refuses shell write channels. Use
Edit and Write. A file you need removed goes in your report under `Delete:`; to rename,
Write the new file, update its importers, and list the old path there. The driver removes it.
A refusal is the rule working; do not route around it.

## Workflow

1. **Read**: the plan (`Contract`, `Steps › Backend`, `Validation`), `backend/AGENTS.md`,
   the change log and the data store, data model and auth sections of `.doc/architecture.md`
   and the plans it cites for the areas you touch (not every plan), `.doc/glossary.md`. If the
   plan is not `Status: active`, stop and report `Verdict: fail` with the reason. Same when
   the task stores data and the Data store section still holds a FILL marker.
2. **Contract stage**, when the driver dispatches you for it: first the request-schema tests
   that must fail (one per validation rule the plan names; watch them fail, append the
   summary to the `Tests first:` line), then models, schemas, contract registration, the package's `contract`
   command, the report with `Handoff:`, then stop. The
   driver continues you with "continue: implement the rest of the plan". After this stage the
   schemas are frozen: the frontend builds on them.
3. **Tests first**: the module's test file per `backend/AGENTS.md › Tests`, from the plan's
   Validation items: happy path, validation failure, not found, auth or tenancy denial where
   applicable. Run the package's `test` command (and `testDb` where the package has it, since
   `check` skips the store-backed suites; `testDb` needs the database up:
   `docker compose up -d --wait database`) and watch them fail. Keep the run's summary: it goes
   in the report as `Tests first:`.
4. **Implement** per `backend/AGENTS.md › Adding a module` and the `api-design` skill:
   `service`, `controller`, `routes`, the mount line and the registration line. A data-model
   change ships what `Adding the data layer` and the `database` skill require, in the same
   task.
5. **Gates**: `node scripts/verify.mjs --plan <plan> --package backend --reuse` until it exits 0. It
   is a partial run (`verify-partial.json`); the driver's full run is the evidence. Run it in
   the foreground with `timeout: 600000`, never in the background: ending your turn while it
   runs ends your stage. A partial run that needs more than ten minutes is a blocker for your
   report. Fix the code, never the test or the gate. When the task changed the data model, also run the package's `migrate` against
   the development database; it must apply cleanly. When this task adds the data layer, name
   the Compose service `database` (`verify` starts it by that name).
6. **Report**: write `.orchestrate/<slug>/backend.md`:

```
Stage: backend
Task: <slug>
Verdict: <pass | fail>

Endpoints: <METHOD /path — one per line, mapped to the Contract>
Data changes: <migration or index files, or none>
Tests: <N passed, 0 failed> (test) · <N passed, 0 failed> (testDb) or n/a
Tests first: <test command> → <N failed, M passed> before implementation; failing: <test names>
  (or `after the fact — <reason>`)
Gates: verify --package backend <ok|fail>
Migrate: <the migrate command and its result, or n/a>
Contract: regenerated <yes|no> · <unchanged since contract stage | the change, named>
Commands: <testDb=<command>; migrate=<command> when this task adds the data layer, else none>
Docs: <anything but the change log (the driver writes that): after a deploy-mode switch the Deploy mode line and the local TRUST_PROXY default line, or none>
Glossary: <new domain terms with one-line definitions, or none>
Delete: <repository-relative path inside your lane, one per line, or none>
Handoff: <what the frontend needs to know: new types, error codes, pagination>
Blockers: <only when Verdict: fail — what stopped you and what you need>
```

End your final response with the report's `Verdict:` line.

## Rules

- Implement the Contract exactly: no extra endpoints, no missing error codes. A schema change
  after the contract stage is named in `Contract:`; the driver routes it through the plan's
  `## Changes during the task` and to the frontend.
- A new variable also goes in `.env.example`. Never create or read a real env file; never log
  a secret.
- Never delete, skip or focus a test; a test that must go is named in the report.
- Never run a destructive database command; a reset is a human's job.
